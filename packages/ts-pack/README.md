# TS-Pack

A preconfigured [rollup.js]() bundler for Typescript Libraries, with additional aid to help configure the library's `package.json`.

## Usage

```
  A preconfigured bundler using local package.json + tsconfig.json to bundle your library.

  Configurations via flags or package.json:
    --help, -h, pack.help
        Display this message

    --doctor, -d, pack.doctor
        Perform a check on package.json's configuration

    --tsConfig, -c, pack.tsConfig
        Specify the typescript config to use on build
        default: 'tsconfig.json'

    --inputFile, -i, pack.inputFile
        Specify the entry point to bundle.
        default: 'src/index.ts'

    --bundle, -b, pack.bundle
        Bundle all dependencies in distribution.
        Useful for only relying on native node dependencies. i.e. lambdas
        default: false

    --preserveModules, -p, pack.preserveModules
        Preserved for future usage, currently does not affect bundling
        default: false
```

### Requirements

This library will only work on Node v18 or higher, this is because it utilises new improvements such as the new parseArgs module.

### Doctor

Help setup `package.json` the right way, the first time! Doctor will help guide through the set up and identify missing properties.

For an [NPM]() library, package.json is **the** informer of what your library is, and how your library operates. Doctor is there to cover the bases for 80% of use-cases.

> Multiple modules are currently not supported, see [Roadmap](#roadmap) for more information.

Example terminal output from Doctor:

ES Module Package Detected

 â—‹ - Exports Common JS

While optional for ES Module Packages, this choice can break environments who haven't adopted ESM yet.

 âœ“ - Exports ES Module
 âœ“ - Exported ES Module Correct File Extension
 â—‹ - Exports Types for developers

Exporting types, while optional, aid developers who consume your library.
Add "types": "<dist folder>/<@types folder>/index.d.ts" to give them a hand!

 âœ“ - Limited files packaged on release
 âœ“ - Additional bundler support - Root
 âœ“ - Additional bundler support - Root ES Modules
```

### Build

Create bundles determined by properties present in `package.json` with help from a custom `pack` property or script flags.

#### Notable Properties

- `main` : CommonJS bundle.
- `module` : ES Module bundle.
- `types` : Type declaration bundle.

#### Pack configuration

If you want to persist configurations without using flags, custom `package.json` options are available.

- `pack.inputFile` : Single entry point file.
- `pack.tsConfig` : Specify a tsconfig.json file to use for bundling.
- `pack.bundle` : Include external dependencies in the minified output bundle.

## Roadmap

1. Enable Watch mode.

2. Support React 18's Server Side Components' "use client" directive.

3. Enable multiple inputs for libraries which export more than one module.

Many libraries have multiple named modules exported to either reduce size or complexity as an 'opt-in' measure. This is enabled through the `"exports"` property in package.json.
